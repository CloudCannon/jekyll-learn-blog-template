## Description
The Kereru / New Zealand wood pigeon is a large and attractively coloured pigeon found all around New Zealand, and which is New Zealand's only endemic pigeon. Unlike many other birds, it has no calls or birdsong to offer. However, that doesnâ€™t stop it being heard - its heavy flapping of wings and whooshing as it flies by are easily recognised. 

Kereru are also well known for their love of berries, of which they eat a considerable amount. However, some of their favourite berries have a tendency to ferment, which raises their alcohol content. Unsurprisingly, this affects the birds who have one too many, and they are known to get a bit tipsy.

## Conservation status

The kereru is currently stable and not threatened, but they have experienced decline in the past. Kereru are vulnerable to predators, such as stoats and ferrets, which eat eggs and even maim or kill the birds themselves. Possums also provide competition for food.
