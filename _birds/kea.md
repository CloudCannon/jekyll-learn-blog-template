## Description 
The kea is the world’s only alpine parrot, able to live in harsh, snowy conditions. They are known for their high intelligence and social nature, and they are excellent problem solvers that can work together on remarkably complex tasks.

Their curiosity also brings them into areas frequented by humans. Tourists are often charmed by their playful nature - but care needs to be taken, as they love to “disassemble” anything they can get their beaks into.

## Conservation status

Unfortunately, these noble parrots are threatened and need ongoing protection, with a population less than 10,000. Introduced predators such as stoats, cats and possums have greatly hurt their populations. Their desire to pull things apart and eat has also led to them consuming poisons in their environments, and they were once considered a pest to be shot by farmers. Considerable efforts have been made to protect and help kea populations.
