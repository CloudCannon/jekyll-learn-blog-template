## Description

New Zealand has a number of interesting and endangered parrots. The forest-dwelling kaka, like its alpine relative the kea, is another one of these. While physically similar to the kea, the kaka is much more social, often seen in large, boisterous groups. 

Two subspecies exist - one each in the North and South Island. Both feature olive-brown as well as crimson feathers, but with minor differences.

## Conservation status

Both kaka species are threatened, particularly the North Island kaka. South Island kaka are relatively widespread along the west coast of the South Island. Possums, other predators, and deforestation provide additional pressures
