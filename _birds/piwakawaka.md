## Description 
Piwakawaka, also commonly known as the New Zealand fantail, is a small and inquisitive bird with a lot of energy. Often seen in bush or forest areas, as well as within cities, the piwakawaka doesn’t seem to be shy around humans. This is in part due to humans stirring up insects as they move, which they immediately take advantage of. 

Its role in the legends of the Maori, NZ’s indigenous inhabitants, is not what might be first expected: as a messenger of news, particularly death. Its erratic behaviour and large eyes are also seen in legend to result from being squeezed as a punishment by the demi-god Maui.

Piwakawaka are attractive and easily recognisable birds, with a pleasant chirping call and a large tail which they can fan out - hence their name. Plumage is generally a mixture of tan, brown and white, but black variants are also sometimes seen.

##  Conservation status:
The piwakawaka is widely spread around New Zealand forests and thriving. They adapt very well to environmental changes and produce larger numbers of young than many other birds.
