## Description
A striking, talented songbird loved by all New Zealanders, the tui is found all around the country - in nature and in popular culture. The glossy black/green plumage and white feathers under their neck make them easily recognisable.

Audibly, tui are also quickly recognised by their characteristic mix of whistles and clicking sounds, as well as their particular talent for mimicry - similar to what many parrots are capable of. In certain environments, tui will copy the sounds made by humans, or even other birds. In addition, their bobbing flight pattern and love for nectar in NZ flax bushes make them easy to spot.

## Conservation status
Tui, although the only species in their genus, are not considered threatened and are plentiful in the wild and in cities. Male tui, in particular, can actually be quite aggressive towards other birds.
