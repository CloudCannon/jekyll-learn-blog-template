## Description
The pukeko is a regular site in grasslands, wetlands and swamps around the country. They are easily recognised by their black and blue plumage and large red feet, legs and beak. Pukeko can be quite aggressive in their territories and have been known to damage or attack other species in their areas.

Pukeko are believed to have migrated to New Zealand around 1000 years ago, so while they are considered native, they are not endemic to New Zealand. They can also be found around Australasia, particularly parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.

## Conservation status
Pukeko have adapted very well to changes in their environments, so they are not considered threatened and are widely spread. In fact, there is often a need to control their populations, especially in areas where other threatened species exist.
