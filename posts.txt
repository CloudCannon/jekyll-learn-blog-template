## Welcome to our site!  

 CawCannon is all about bringing you the latest information on the birds, conservation efforts, and other caws for concern in Aotearoa - the Land of the Long White Cloud. 

Here in Aotearoa/New Zealand, we love our unusual wildlife and nature. What makes it especially unusual is that that there are essentially zero dangerous creatures or native predators. Due to separation from other continents and isolation, our flora and fauna have developed in some unique and interesting ways that hark back to life in Gondwanaland.  

Our dense, primeval forests are teeming with life, and most of the larger animals are actually birds - no foxes, wolves, or other large predators. Without these pressures, many of our avian friends have given up the need for flight. A number are also quite curious, mischievous and highly social, with little fear of humans due to this lack of predators.  

As you can expect, this hasn't worked out the best for much of the native fauna, as introduced species quickly took advantage of easy-to-reach eggs and prey. 

However, early on we recognised how much our wildlife and nature are threatened by our activity, and numerous conservation campaigns have been implemented to keep these unique and endangered animals alive - even if almost no-one gets to see them face to face.

We hope you'll enjoy our site and regular updates.

Regards, the CawCannon team

## About the competition
Here in Aotearoa/New Zealand, we love our unique wildlife. In fact, most of it consists of birds, with no natural predators existing until European settlement. Unfortunately, many of these wonderful creatures had evolved - often in strange ways - to manage without the pressures of predators. This has led to many flightless birds, and a number of others with high curiosity, which has made them easy prey for newly introduced predators.

As a way of celebrating their diversity, as well as creating awareness of how threatened many are, the [Bird of the Year](https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/) competition has been run since 2005 by our largest independent conservation organisation, [Forest and Bird](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/). This has since become an important event each year, especially on social media, and known globally. Depending on the year, it might even rival the general elections (government) in popularity.

## Introduction

Loud, screeching, ravenous and aggressive. For many, this is the perception of seagulls - simply an annoyance.

But many people don't realise the plight of these seabirds, which are in decline or heavily endangered. Being a cute and cuddly looking kakapo, critically endangered and loved by all, makes conservation efforts and public opinion trivial. But how do we get people to respect something that looks severe and is aggressive? This is a great dilemma for the much maligned gull they, like all seabirds, play an important role in their environments and are worthy of conservation efforts, even if we don't appreciate their behaviour.

## Quick facts

The tarapunga/red-billed gull has a population of around 500,000, although this seemingly high number is only the result of strong conservation efforts. In previous decades, these gulls had been under huge threat of invasive predators and close to facing extinction. But even now, they aren't out of the (drift)woods yet, with climate pressures and difficulty with predators still issues that could cause populations to plummit. 

The tarapuka/black-billed gull, a lesser seen seabird, is even worse off. It has the unfortunate status of being one of the most threatened gulls in the world, with a population of only about 60,000. Although more common around rivers and much quieter, they look quite similar to their "pesky" red-billed relatives. This doesn't help people recognise them as different and in desperate need of help.

## Conclusion

Even though many think of gulls as a nuisance, it's worth keeping in mind how fragile their populations are, and how far conservation efforts have already come. They are also vital members of their environments, so maybe we should think twice before considering them useless pests.
